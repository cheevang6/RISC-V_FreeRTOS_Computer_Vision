1.  Changed sensitivity list from SCCB_CLK to XCLK
2.  Moved "step" changing from it's own always loop into FSM
3.  Protocol requires SIO_D to transmit when SIO_C is low
	  + hence, added "SCCB_MID_PULSE" to do this

4.  Need to fix start transmission where
	  + SIO_D driven to 1 for tPRC = 15 ns (whild SIO_C is idle)
	  + then, SIO_C driven to 0
